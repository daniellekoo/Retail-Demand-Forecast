# Retail-Demand-Forecast
Demand forecasting using baseline and ML models

## Project Overview
This project focuses on forecasting retail demand and evaluating whethere machine learning models can outperform a provided baseline demand forecast. 
Using a real-world-style retail dataset, I compared baseline performance with multiple ML approaches, experimented with feature engineering (including lag features and weekly aggregation), and analyzed feature importance to understand key demand drivers.
